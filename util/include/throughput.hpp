/**
 * A Throughput object is used to calculate the number of items processed in a time unit.
 * After construction, it must be started by calling start(). It can be paused by calling pause().
 * While paused, reports cannot be made. To continue call resume().
 * To end use, call end(). After ending, pause and resume are not allowed, only start() can be called to re-use the
 * object. In order to get meaningful statistics, user should report periodically to the object on the processing
 * progress by calling report().
 *
 * If the user supplies a windowSize > 0:
 * 1) User may call all member functions prefixed with getPrevWin*.
 * 2) Last window throughput is calculated and saved.
 * 3) Overall and last window calculations are based on the window's end time.
 * 4) report() returns true when the window's end reached.
 *
 * To get overall and/or last window statistics, the user has 2 options:
 * 1) If windowSize > 0, it should waits until report() returns true and then it may call getOverallResults()
 * and/or getPrevWinResults().
 * 2) If windowSize is 0, user can call at any time for getOverallResults(). Calling report() to continue collecting
 * statistics is still possible after.
